# Rick & Morty Character Wiki

This Rick & Morty Character Wiki is a React JS application built using React, JavaScript, Node.js, Bootstrap, Sass and an Open API.

The app allows users to search for their favourite Rick & Morty characters via a search bar and data filtering (including filter by status, species or gender) section. The users can click on a specific character card to get full available infomation for each character (their name, status, gender, species, type, location and origin).

Users can also check which character/s have appeared in specific episodes and locations using a drop down menu created in the corresponding Episodes or Location sections of the app. In total there are 800+ characters, each page will display up to 20 characters, so I've added a pagination system at the bottom of each page to allow the user to view all the results available if needed.

## Main Learning Points:

* Using `fetch()` to get data from an API and `map()` results.
* Reading API docs and understanding how to use them.
* Practice creating an app which included asynchronous programming, async, await, fetch(), React Hooks (useState, useEffect).
* Bootstrap and Sass - for styling.
* Implementing Pagination.
* Creating a Search bar.
* Data Filtering.
* Dynamic Routing.
* How to easily and efficiently use React JS and Bootstrap to handle projects.
* Making the app fully responsive for small, medium and large devices.

## Built with:

* React.js
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* Bootstrap
* Sass
* Rick & Morty Open API

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
