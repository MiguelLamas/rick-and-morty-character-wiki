# Rick & Morty Character Wiki

This Rick & Morty Character Wiki is a React JS application built using React, JavaScript, Node.js, Bootstrap, Sass and an Open API.

The app allows users to search for their favourite Rick & Morty characters via a search bar and data filtering (including filter by status, species or gender) section. The users can click on a specific character card to get full available infomation for each character (their name, status, gender, species, type, location and origin).

Users can also check which character/s have appeared in specific episodes and locations using a drop down menu created in the corresponding Episodes or Location sections of the app. In total there are 800+ characters, each page will display up to 20 characters, so I've added a pagination system at the bottom of each page to allow the user to view all the results available if needed.

## Main Learning Points:

* Using `fetch()` to get data from an API and `map()` results.
* Reading API docs and understanding how to use them.
* Practice creating an app which included asynchronous programming, async, await, fetch(), React Hooks (useState, useEffect).

* Implementing Pagination.
